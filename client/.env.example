# REACT_APP_API_BASE is read at build time by Create React App.
# In development you can use http://localhost:3001, in production use '/api' to route to serverless functions.

# For local development (if your backend runs on port 3001):
# REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001

# For production (when backend is served as serverless functions under /api):
